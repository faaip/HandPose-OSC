# n4m-handpose
Wraps [HandPose](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/handpose) inside electron and serves the detected parts via MaxAPI.



Based around [Yuichi Yogo](https://github.com/yuichkun)'s great work porting Electron + Tensorflow models into [Node For Max](https://github.com/Cycling74/n4m-examples)
